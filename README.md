# Push_Swap Project at 42

## Introduction
Welcome to the Push_Swap project, part of the 42 school curriculum. This project is designed to challenge students with sorting algorithms and data structures, particularly focusing on stacks. The objective is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

## Project Description
In this project, we implement a sorting algorithm using two stacks, named `a` and `b`. The goal is to sort the numbers in stack `a` while keeping the least number of operations. The challenge lies in optimizing the sorting algorithm and the sequence of operations.

### Key Features:
- Implementation of efficient sorting algorithms.
- Usage of stack data structures.
- Optimization of operations to sort the numbers.

### Technologies:
- Language: C
- Environment: Unix/Linux

## Installation
To install and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/LouisRaverdy/push_swap.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:
```
cd push_swap
```

3. Compile the program:
```
make
```

## Usage
After compiling the project, you can run it using the following command:

### Example:
```
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
```
This command will output a series of operations that will sort the numbers in stack `a`.

## Bonus Part
As an additional challenge, the project includes a bonus part which can be compiled using the `make bonus` command. This bonus part often includes extra features or more complex scenarios to implement.

To compile the bonus part, run:
```
make bonus
```
